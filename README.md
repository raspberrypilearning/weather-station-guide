# Raspberry Pi weather station

![](weather.png)

The Weather Station kit is a HAT for the Raspberry Pi which allows it to collect weather data using a variety of sensors. It is designed to be used in schools to enable students to create their own weather station, and has a range of resources to support its use.

As well as logging data locally, schools that received a free Weather Station can log their data in a central Oracle database, so they can share information and collaborate with schools around the world.
